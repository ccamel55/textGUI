# textGUI

Simple text GUI written in C++. Originally wirtten for a project I was working on, 
however others might find this useful. 

Requires C++ 11 or newer due to the use of smart pointers.
## Getting Started

If you just want to start using this GUI, all you need to do is edit :
```internal/wrapper.h```.

You should already  have a working render and input class as they are not 
included (I might upload my render and input class at a later date).

By default the GUI will populate it's self with a demo layout. To add your own, 
just delete the demo layout and populate with your own variables. This is found in : 
```textGUI.cpp```
